To use this facial recognition code, please follow these steps:

    Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed, including OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow.
    Download the Haar cascade file for face detection and save it as "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" in the same directory as this code.
    Download the pre-trained TensorFlow model for object recognition and save it as "model.h5" in the same directory as this code.
    Prepare a reference image that you want to compare the detected faces with and save it as "test.PNG" in the same directory.
    Connect a webcam to your computer and ensure it is properly set up.
    Run the code and grant necessary permissions for accessing the webcam.
    The code will continuously capture frames from the webcam, detect and label faces, and display the results in a window.
    If a detected face matches the reference image above a certain threshold, an alert message will be displayed on the frame.
    Press the 'q' key to exit the program.
